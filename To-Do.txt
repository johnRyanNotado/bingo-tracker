add ready state change function that will tell that the page is ready

document.addEventListener("readystatechange", (event) => {
  if (event.target.readyState === "complete") {
    initApp();
  }
});

the initApp will start to call different functions that will initialize the things needed to be initialized and add event listeners to those that needs it.
